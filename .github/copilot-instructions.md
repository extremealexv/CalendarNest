# Copilot Instructions for CalendarNest

## Project Overview
CalendarNest appears to be in the early planning or design phase. The workspace currently contains:
- `CalendarNest.md`: Presumed to be a project overview, requirements, or design document.
- `UI_Mockup.png`: Likely a visual mockup of the intended user interface.

## Key Guidance for AI Agents
- **Start by reading `CalendarNest.md`** to understand the project's goals, requirements, and any described workflows or features.
- **Reference `UI_Mockup.png`** for UI/UX design cues. If implementing UI, align with the mockup's structure and style.
- **No code or build system is present yet.** If asked to scaffold or implement features, propose a project structure and justify choices based on the content of `CalendarNest.md` and the mockup.
- **Document all architectural and workflow decisions** in markdown files alongside code, especially as the project evolves from planning to implementation.
- **If you add new files or folders,** update this instruction file with new conventions or patterns as they emerge.

## Example Workflow
1. Read `CalendarNest.md` for requirements.
2. Review `UI_Mockup.png` for design.
3. Propose or scaffold a project structure (e.g., React app, backend API) based on requirements.
4. Document any new conventions or decisions here.

## When in Doubt
- Ask for clarification if requirements are ambiguous.
- Prefer explicit documentation of new patterns or workflows as the codebase grows.
